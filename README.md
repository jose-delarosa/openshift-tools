# openshift-tools
Set of tools and configuration files to deploy OpenShift clusters

* `bin/`: Scripts to install OpenShift in a very custom environment, as well as simple applications once OpenShift is up and running.

* `config/`: Contains the DNS, DHCP and haproxy configuration files that I use. These are also customized for my personal environment and won't work as-is anywhere else, but they can be used to build your own.
